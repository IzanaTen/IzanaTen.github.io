            <h2>Adobe Games.</h2>

            <p>

                There are games written in ActionScript that are compiled into .swf files, which were able to be played on browsers with the Adobe Player plugin. Unfortunately, since 2020 this plugin is no longer supported, making it impossible to play these games on browsers.
                <br><br>
                However, there is a program, or rather a group of programs in various versions, that has the ability to play .swf games, and it is called Adobe Flash Player.
                <br><br>
                Here is a <a href="https://izanaten.github.io/Download.html">[Link]</a> to a page where you can download any version you want. You will find versions from 2 to 32, and official Players.

            <h2>What is Adobe Flash Player?</h2>
